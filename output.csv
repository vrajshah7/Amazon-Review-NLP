    Without a doubt a masterpiece! üëç
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    ""What did God do before he created the universe? Augustine didn‚Äôt reply: He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions. Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, and that time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.""Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey from the time when the world believed that Earth was the center of the universe and supported on the back of a giant tortoise to our age when we know better. Without the use of any mathematical equation, except the one famous mass energy equivalence relation by Einstein, he has explained the nature of our universe, from the smallest particles which cannot be seen to the biggest entities, the black holes in a simple language.The manner in which Hawking broke down complex concepts in theoretical physics, along with his adept use¬†of humor, he clearly won over the readers who otherwise might have found themselves intimidated by physics and maths.I recommend it to all people who are interested in physics and cosmology but hate equations. üòÑ

    A very good book.This book is like a tree.You can climb up that tree and when you reach the top you have a very clear view of everything . But climbing the tree up is somewhat difficult while you are still on the trunk.The first two chapters form this ""trunk"" and the rest are branches.If you suceed in climbing up the trunk then nobody can stop you from reaching the top.

    Intriguing read for those who wonder about our universe!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    A brief history of time... What a fascinating book! This is probably the first time I read through an entire book where I only understood a fraction of what was explained, due to my limited understanding on the topic. In other circumstances I would have left it incomplete. However with this gem, it made me wonder about various principles I had heard about in high school, and search for some cool videos online explaining them in an easy to understand language.If you have wondered about the big bang, black holes, elementary particles, general relativity, quantum mechanics, space and time, or the laws of the universe, this book is for you!This book reminds one of how beautiful, fascinating and intriguing our universe is! I don't think the author could have simplified things any further. I rate the book a 5-star for keeping me engaged, for making me explore concepts I wouldn't have otherwise, and for reminding me of the wonders of the universe.

Page quality and printing is average (expected at this price point) however not an issue with legibility.  3. Cover and back are thick paper with plastic coating.  4. The language is very simple and easy to understand. Any fifth standard and above child should be able to  read it. The understandabilty of contents is great due to easy language used.  5. The topics are covered in good detail with explanation. The interesting contents about space and time are  something that we should know and understand.I recommend this book for the people who has interest in Space, Time, Planets and Science. I great book for students.If you found the review helpful, please like it.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    It‚Äôs a 200 pages of book which you might think is a one day read but actually it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs complicated and hard to understand at times but what makes this book a masterpiece is the way Hawking explains all the scientific terms in a way that a normal brain can understand it. I loved the way he concluded the book by give briefings on Einstein, Galalio and Newton they were all two pages briefings but they changed my viewpoint on these scientists forever. Take your time and read this.

    I haven't read the book yet so content wise I can't commend. But my problem is with it's quality. The paper quality is very poor and it looks like a second quality stuff. The original rate printed is 399 and I got it for 189 because of the amazon sale. Since I got it so cheap I don't have much to complain I guess, but those who want to buy a good hard copy of this book please look elsewhere. Will update about the actual book content when I finish reading it.

    The book is written by a Scientist who is not only authority on the subject but is also known for making science simple for a layman to understand.Right from the time of Aristotle ( 350 B C ), Scientists & Philosophers have been¬† trying to know more & more about our universe. This book tells us about the various models & theories made & modified from time to time to reach our present day knowledge of universe.At least high school knowledge and interest in¬† Physics is required to appreciate this book.

    There is no point in reviewing the content of the book since it is one of the most popular science books written by one of the greatest scientists of modern era. But the book is not the original one. It is reprinted in India. Hence the poor quality of page and printing. This book is good for personal reading but not for presenting someone else.

    This book is definitely capable of opening one's mind and can possibly answers deep old questions that one might have. This work of Dr Hawking is absolutely a delight to read as it will take you for a ride into the whimsical universe. The book will surely enlighten some questions that you'll be more glad to pursue throughout his writing. What not to say.. This is A Must read especially for the one who still carry in him a child like curiosity.

From relativity to quantum realm ...

    An amazing book, which maps our mind to the World famous Hawking's universe.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This book is good for making a grand knowledge. Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey from the time when the world believed that Earth was the center of the universe and supported on the back of a giant tortoise to our age when we know better. He uses the Einstein's Energy-Mass relation, the Black Holes Ain't So Black. Hawking makes the Science clear & thrilling.Love this book. It's just a brief history of time from the Big Bang theory to the Black Holes.

    Accompanying the insights provided by this book with spirited imaginations , you'll get a feel of how far the human intellectual threshold has been pushed from the beginning of scientific revolution and it's new dimensions that have made somewhat trivial the original framework of human reasoning about nature philosophy .

    A book that every human must read
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This book is a mind opener. Stephen Hawking explains how much we've understood about the universe we live in. The book is written in a simple manner so every one can understand the basic outlook of time, space and the universe using all the theories man has developed til date. Stephen Hawking is an excellent teacher who knows how to explain science in the simplest way possible- as said by many. This book indeed takes us back in time and explains the reality using science as the basic tool. I believe every human should read a book like this one and should be aware of the things that have surrounded him. Our quest for the real answer about the true nature of universe will go on till we understand what it is and why it is the way it is.

    Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time has covered the distant shores of scientific history from Copernicus to Einstein and explains the developments and discoveries that have happened till date and how these theories have contributed in expanding our knowledge behind the origin of space, time and universe.Whether one is a physics student, a science enthusiast, or a layman.. this book is capable of sparking a further interest in the reader's mind to explore the vast area of scientific progress as well as problems that are inspiring human minds for years to uncover the mysteries behind the evolution of universe and that of our own existance.

I would personally recommend to read the ""physics of the impossible "" by Michio Kaku which would help to get familiar with many concepts discussed here .

    A fascinating book on our universe. But not an easy read.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    What do we know about the universe? How do we know what we know? Where did the universe come from and where is it going? What is the nature of time? Did time have a beginning? Will it ever come to an end? If time had a beginning what was there ‚Äòbefore‚Äô it began? The Brief History of Time is Professor Hawking‚Äôs attempt to explain answers to these fundamental questions to the common people. Of course, we do not have the exact answers to all these questions but we have quite some understanding of the universe based on various scientific theories. Professor Hawking has tried to explain such concepts in a simple language without using any formula. Some theories and facts blew my mind. And some were too difficult for my understanding. But Professor Hawking surely tested my capacity to imagine and fascinated me by providing a glimpse of the vastness and mystery of our universe. If you have some interest in understanding the universe and various basic concepts of science (knowledge is not required; that will be provided by Professor Hawking) you will find the book fascinating.I have read reviews saying that this is a very simple and effortless read because of author's lucid writing style. That is not true. Although the book is written in a simple language, it is a book on science and some of the concepts are difficult to understand. So, do not expect this to be an easy and effortless read. If you are not inclined think or imagine on a little bit complex scientific topics, you may avoid reading it.

    The universe and black holes explained beautifully by Mr.hawking. the book takes the reader into a world way beyond earth.it makes everyday things and thoughts feel tiny. Also generates tremendous respect towards the works of all scientists that have led to such deep understanding of the universe. Dr.hawking has explained all the concepts of physics required to understand the theories, in simple terms and sometimes in comic analogies. However I suggest ppl should get an idea of Einstein's general theory of relativity to get a better understanding of the book.

    Factual yet readers can criticize.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Progression of science is presented in this book,  particularly focused on basic questions humans ponder about. Hawking presents how it started out with philosophers to how the present situation is, in the field of cosmology. This book must be considered with philosophical viewpoint and not as a text book with equations in fact this book has only one equation in mathematical form and few others scattered in verbal form. Readers need not have to understand any equation or natural laws or theories defined in this book, hawking quickly digresses from these to connect with people without science background.Hawkings thoughts on God is clearly represented in this book. Through out this book Hawking shows how science advances gradually to understand the universe but man is thrown back, he ends up back in square one.  Readers can critisize this book or in fact science in philosophical terms, since even science has not given any answers yet. The byproduct of science, Engineering, has been phenomenal and hats off to them. Spoiler alert-- science hinges on few things today, they want answers from singularity(unified field) either from a black hole or unified field theory with good probability for the theory being true. And another parallel study is string theory. Hawking has proposed new theory in loop quantum gravity which is very far away from being true right now. All these three sectors and along with other researchers thinking out of the box seems to have hit dead end. The past few decades have been stagnant although they discovered gravitational waves and microwave background images, these would not even be good paintings to hang it in your home. Good luck linking gravity with quantum mechanics.Throughout the book you can observe how the author behaves like, he want to call himself smart person and brings about indirectly. Literally in the final page of the book hawking says Ludwig Wittgenstein is the most famous philosopher of 20th century, peraphs Stephen Hawking should go through Albert Camus whose philosophical ideas are logical. Wittgenstein was just an angry bloke.

    A perfect starting point for curious amateurs like me. Simple language, no complex equations (except the famous equation by Einstein), few helpful diagrams which together make it a very engrossing read.The product, however, was not brand new. The paper quality is fine but there were a few marks on the cover.

    i'm really impressed about how easily Stephen Hawking explains cosmos in simple layman's terms, even though i've just read a few chapters, i have never been that into any book before. This book explains about space & time, origin of universe, black holes and many more interesting stuff about our universe. if you are a science lover then you are definitely gonna love this book. The downside is that the paper quality is poor and the book has a weird smell.

    A must read book for theoretical Physics starters - simple and easy to understand !!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I once read somewhere that if there is a book that is sold more than bible than it was this book. Of course, I later found it to be an exaggeration by the writer of that fact but yes, it was sold heavily when it was released. First, the book is written by an enigmatic personality who despite having physical limitations has solely discovered many secrets of the universe. Stephen Hawking was already a hero before this book arrived and after this book, he became a sort of legend. This can be easily proven by the fact that he was the professor at the same university and was sitting in the same position where Newton used to sit 300 years back. Everyone bought this book but not many read as they found to be a little complex or rather assumed that since it involved physics so it was supposed to be a complex book. However, the entire book is just philosophy, some science and interesting trivia‚Äôs and facts about our world and beyond. There is only one equation used in the book and that too is the most familiar equation of all time. Even people who hate maths and physics know about the equation. The equation was E equals to M*C(square), the world-famous equation given by Einstein which changed the way scientists looked at the matter and helped them invent many things thereafter. The book is not autobiographical and the author never talks about himself in the book. He only talks about the universe and its law in the most basic fashion that there could be. I was in the final year of my school and I was preparing for my engineering exams when my cousin visited my home and during a casual conversation asked me whether I know that time is absolute. I was offended to know such a fact because it opposed everything I knew and was taught. I was like how can two different people have two different time zones. I totally negated him but then to prove himself right he asked me to read this book called ‚ÄúA brief history of time‚Äù which I had seen on books stands previously but never took the courage to buy it.Finally, I bought it and it opened my eyes to so many things about science which I didn‚Äôt know before. It opened an entirely new world for me like why we live in three dimensions and not more or less than that, and why time is relative and what is the exact meaning of the Einstein‚Äôs famous equation. I also got to know a lot about black holes which again I find it to be a very interesting topic and later I read an entire book on the same subject by the same author. There was a time when I thought that maybe Hawking‚Äôs was obsessed about Blackholes but after reading a lot about Black holes I came to know why. The theories about black holes solved myriads of mysteries of science. Black holes are also related to time travel, the most used and most favourite topic of writing for science fiction authors. This book is brilliant because even a man with no science background can read it and find it interesting. You don‚Äôt expect such kind of simple language from a scientist because normally such kind of topics are aimed at only a section of people who have a background on such topics. I think every kid should be made to read this book so that they can develop some interest in science. I think I read it very later in life because if I had read it earlier, I would have opted for science as a career and not filmmaking. I was good in science and theoretical physics had always attracted me. However, this book is also the reason why I ranked less in my exams that year because this book started a chain of thoughts inside me which led me to buy more books and I ended up buying more books on the same subject, mostly by him and Roger Penrose, another author whom I love dearly. In the end, I would just like to say that this book is a must read and you should give it a go.

    I bought this book from a local bookstore. I think this book is overrated. The book is nice but the way he tells the story is quite boring. No doubt this is one of the most unread book according to goodreads. This book is nice if you wanna show-off how intellectual you are to your friends but actually reading it a different thing. No doubt Stephen Hawking was a great scientist. What he did while being physically handicapped is astonishing and inspirational but I think he is not a great story teller/writer. You can find other pop. science books which are easier to read and enjoyable.

    To start, I'm dumb. But even I was able to increase my quench for space knowledge by reading this masterpiece of a book.Before getting my hands on this brilliant piece of product, I used to watch a plethora of space related stuff on YouTube without being able to grasp the concept in the entirety. But reading this book alone has taught me rudimentary concepts in a clear and lucid way, Stephen Hawking was a scientist as we all know but I'd argue that he was an artist as well. Because teaching a subject as intricate as space using layman terms isn't exactly easy.I wish he was still present, nonetheless I'm grateful for his contribution.Anyway, as for the ratings, 10/10 would recommend.

You develop interest in the darkest secrets of Universe and that too by employing only ONE mathematical equation in the entire book....the very famouse = mc2....I wish he had also written some books about relativity also so as to understand the topics....hats off to the great man!!!!!

I've had to go back to re-read any paragraph or page to understand the concept behind it.Sometimes I also have to search for some words on google to understand the meanings. It has many theories explained by sir stephen Hawking which needs more than 1 read to make it clear.This book is definetly not for speed reading like any novel. Very hard to understand things but once you get it clear in your mind, you are gonna love this book, believe me!!!

But I believe, to understand this book deeply people should first refer different books to understand some important laws such as relativity, Maxwell's equations, general relativity and other important topics. If people really know these topics then this book is very interesting.

    I'll start by stating that this is not a book for total beginners. If you know nothing about Astrophysics or Physics, in general then you're not going to understand this book. But if you are a little Scientifically inclined, this is one of the best non-technical books that you'll ever come across.

    A very, very, very big problem
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Stephen William Hawking, one of the leading theoretical physicists on the planet and a very famous cosmologist, is the author of this book 'A Brief History of Time' and also many others. It explains relativity beautifully and tries to dig as deeply as possible into the wierd laws of physics and tries feverishly to explain the ultimate mystery: the theory of everything (or abbreviated to ToE).  The problem is the book was written BEFORE a certain period, and that was a very important period. Hawking lost a lot of... bets. For instance he said nobody would ever find the Higgs particle, a boson (force carrier) that is supposed to be the cosmic glue that gives all matter mass and,‚Ä¶ practically makes everything behave the way it does. The Tevetron accelerator in Chicago, USA claims it has found the God particle. The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN in Europe has found its evidence THREE TIMES. The third time LHC found evidence of the Higgs Boson, it was certain that it exists. But nobody knows why Hawking claimed that the Higgs doesn't exist. It must have had something to do with his theory of inflation, in which he states that the universe was once nothing but an infinitely small, infinitely hot and infinitely dense singularity and then it popped (and inflated) out of no-where and no-when and then doubled in size 1,00,000 times in a trillionth of a second and it inflated and inflated for about 13.8 billion years until we get a universe like the one we see today. So, it's all baffled up. It's all a bizzare. Everyone has his or her throries. Now, according to me, we will have to count on experiments to take out the correct theory out of a zillion as we are on our quest to find out the beautiful truth, the true nature of reality, the... ToE.  Also, recently Stephen made a bet with South African theorist Neil Turok that gravitational waves are out there in the cosmos that would support his theory of inflation. Neil Turok was working with a theorist named Paul Steinhardt from across the Atlantic and their assistants Burt and Justin on a mind-bending theory called the m-theory (the sibling of the string theory). Neil states that the big bang was not a beginning but a collision. A collision between two extremely flexible surfaces called 'branes' (short for 'membrane'). This theory also says that for this reason, there can be no gravitational waves (and yeah, it also says that there are 11 dimensions, but leave that for a sec). So, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA) launched the Planck satellite to see if there are gravitational waves out there or not and which out of the two cosmological theories is true. Space organizations worldwide like ISRO and ENSARC awaited its answer until the results were out: it denied any evidence of gravitational waves, good for Turok. But a ground-based observatory states it has found evidence of gravitational waves. We are not sure what can we conclude, given that a space observatory is supposed to issue more promising and detailed results than a ground-based one. But most people believe Stephen lost this bet.  The biggest thing, that could perhaps prove the whole book wrong, is THE BLACK HOLE WAR. It was a war between Hawking and one of the most intelligent humans on Earth, one of the leading international theoretical physicists, Prof. Leonard Susskind. Hawking once claimed that one of the most sacred law of physics, the law of conservation of information, which states that you cannot destroy any information in the cosmos (for instance, even an atom bomb, or anything stronger you can imagine might vapourize everything in sight, but somewhere out there in the universe, that information is still there, no matter how scrambled), can be broken down inside black holes. He stated this fact after suspecting the evidence of the Hawking radiation when he saw that there are certain places in the universe where something called 'virtual particles' may become real: JUST near the event horizon of a black hole. Susskind completely disagrees at the fact that information can be lost inside black holes. He believed that this law cannot be broken anywhere, even inside these cosmic monsters. If information is lost, it means most of the modern physics had to be seriously flawed. This was way more than a bet. It was a war. After decades of researching, Susskind came up with a brilliant idea! He resolved a black hole paradox, usually called the dead-and-alive paradox, to win the black hole war. Imagine two astronauts, one named Ram and the other named Shyam, were going to explore a black hole in a space ship and see what happened to a human if he/she jumps into a black hole. When they got there, Shyam decided to jump out into the black hole. From Shyam's point of view, he smoothly drifted towards the black hole. When he reached the event horizon, he started feeling uncomfortable and was stretched somewhat like a Spaghetti, feeling more weight at the legs than the head. Then he started getting awfully fast and saw strange pictures. His brain collapsed and he was ripped apart when he approached the singularity. From his point of view, he died. And from Ram's point of view? He smoothly drifted towards the black hole but as soon as he reached the event horizon, Shyam froze in time. Now, what can we say about Shyam? In one scenario, he dies. In the other, he is frozen in time, but still alive. That is what we call the dead-and-alive paradox. Now Susskind resolved this paradox by substituting Ram's spaceship with a classic airplane with a propeller. Then he came up with a theory called the holographic principle. It says that all the 3-D universe is represented as a 2-D information in the very edges of our universe AND it also says that's why information CANNOT be lost inside black holes or anywhere in the cosmos. Soon, Hawking accepted defeat. And Leonard's theory became a fact. It forced everyone yo picture reality in a new way. Everything turned upside down. Leonard Susskind won the black hole war. Modern physics was now safe.  So, to conclude, I am not saying that Stephen Hawking is an unsuccessful physicist. No! He is one of the most successfull and greatest scientist since Einstein! Just wait if he publishes any other book. I am sure he would rewrite it completely in the correct way. Besides, you know what they say, that we all learn from our mistakes!  Boy, I can't believe I wrote this much! Besides, I'm not a fast typer. This took me one and a quarter hours to complete. Also, typing on a Kindle is a lot harder than on PCs. But still, to help.  Hope this helps.  Don't lose interest in physics. It's awfully interesting!
