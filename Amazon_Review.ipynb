Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, and that time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.\"Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey from the time when the world believed that Earth was the center of the universe and supported on the back of a giant tortoise to our age when we know better. Without the use of any mathematical equation, except the one famous mass energy equivalence relation by Einstein, he has explained the nature of our universe, from the smallest particles which cannot be seen to the biggest entities, the black holes in a simple language.The manner in which Hawking broke down complex concepts in theoretical physics, along with his adept use\\xa0of humor, he clearly won over the readers who otherwise might have found themselves intimidated by physics and maths.I recommend it to all people who are interested in physics and cosmology but hate equations. 😄\\n',\n",

I would personally recommend to read the \"physics of the impossible \" by Michio Kaku which would help to get familiar with many concepts discussed here .\\n',\n",

It is a time travel with the greatest astrophysicists in history explaining the evolution of science. It is good for students, science enthusiasts. It summarises all the important achievements in science in nutshell upto the time of writing of this book and caps it with the author's findings too.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nWhat do we know about the universe? How do we know what we know? Where did the universe come from and where is it going? What is the nature of time? Did time have a beginning? Will it ever come to an end? If time had a beginning what was there ‘before’ it began? The Brief History of Time is Professor Hawking’s attempt to explain answers to these fundamental questions to the common people. Of course, we do not have the exact answers to all these questions but we have quite some understanding of the universe based on various scientific theories. Professor Hawking has tried to explain such concepts in a simple language without using any formula. Some theories and facts blew my mind. And some were too difficult for my understanding. But Professor Hawking surely tested my capacity to imagine and fascinated me by providing a glimpse of the vastness and mystery of our universe. If you have some interest in understanding the universe and various basic concepts of science (knowledge is not required; that will be provided by Professor Hawking) you will find the book fascinating.I have read reviews saying that this is a very simple and effortless read because of author's lucid writing style. That is not true. Although the book is written in a simple language, it is a book on science and some of the concepts are difficult to understand. So, do not expect this to be an easy and effortless read. If you are not inclined think or imagine on a little bit complex scientific topics, you may avoid reading it.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nStephen Hawking does full justice to the subject of the book...even having left learning of science a long time ago, one feels totally connected to the content right from beginning to the end...numerous concepts that will fascinate readers of all ages and from all backgrounds!!!\\n',\n",

       " '\\nProgression of science is presented in this book,  particularly focused on basic questions humans ponder about. Hawking presents how it started out with philosophers to how the present situation is, in the field of cosmology. This book must be considered with philosophical viewpoint and not as a text book with equations in fact this book has only one equation in mathematical form and few others scattered in verbal form. Readers need not have to understand any equation or natural laws or theories defined in this book, hawking quickly digresses from these to connect with people without science background.Hawkings thoughts on God is clearly represented in this book. Through out this book Hawking shows how science advances gradually to understand the universe but man is thrown back, he ends up back in square one.  Readers can critisize this book or in fact science in philosophical terms, since even science has not given any answers yet. The byproduct of science, Engineering, has been phenomenal and hats off to them. Spoiler alert-- science hinges on few things today, they want answers from singularity(unified field) either from a black hole or unified field theory with good probability for the theory being true. And another parallel study is string theory. Hawking has proposed new theory in loop quantum gravity which is very far away from being true right now. All these three sectors and along with other researchers thinking out of the box seems to have hit dead end. The past few decades have been stagnant although they discovered gravitational waves and microwave background images, these would not even be good paintings to hang it in your home. Good luck linking gravity with quantum mechanics.Throughout the book you can observe how the author behaves like, he want to call himself smart person and brings about indirectly. Literally in the final page of the book hawking says Ludwig Wittgenstein is the most famous philosopher of 20th century, peraphs Stephen Hawking should go through Albert Camus whose philosophical ideas are logical. Wittgenstein was just an angry bloke.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nI once read somewhere that if there is a book that is sold more than bible than it was this book. Of course, I later found it to be an exaggeration by the writer of that fact but yes, it was sold heavily when it was released. First, the book is written by an enigmatic personality who despite having physical limitations has solely discovered many secrets of the universe. Stephen Hawking was already a hero before this book arrived and after this book, he became a sort of legend. This can be easily proven by the fact that he was the professor at the same university and was sitting in the same position where Newton used to sit 300 years back. Everyone bought this book but not many read as they found to be a little complex or rather assumed that since it involved physics so it was supposed to be a complex book. However, the entire book is just philosophy, some science and interesting trivia’s and facts about our world and beyond. There is only one equation used in the book and that too is the most familiar equation of all time. Even people who hate maths and physics know about the equation. The equation was E equals to M*C(square), the world-famous equation given by Einstein which changed the way scientists looked at the matter and helped them invent many things thereafter. The book is not autobiographical and the author never talks about himself in the book. He only talks about the universe and its law in the most basic fashion that there could be. I was in the final year of my school and I was preparing for my engineering exams when my cousin visited my home and during a casual conversation asked me whether I know that time is absolute. I was offended to know such a fact because it opposed everything I knew and was taught. I was like how can two different people have two different time zones. I totally negated him but then to prove himself right he asked me to read this book called “A brief history of time” which I had seen on books stands previously but never took the courage to buy it.Finally, I bought it and it opened my eyes to so many things about science which I didn’t know before. It opened an entirely new world for me like why we live in three dimensions and not more or less than that, and why time is relative and what is the exact meaning of the Einstein’s famous equation. I also got to know a lot about black holes which again I find it to be a very interesting topic and later I read an entire book on the same subject by the same author. There was a time when I thought that maybe Hawking’s was obsessed about Blackholes but after reading a lot about Black holes I came to know why. The theories about black holes solved myriads of mysteries of science. Black holes are also related to time travel, the most used and most favourite topic of writing for science fiction authors. This book is brilliant because even a man with no science background can read it and find it interesting. You don’t expect such kind of simple language from a scientist because normally such kind of topics are aimed at only a section of people who have a background on such topics. I think every kid should be made to read this book so that they can develop some interest in science. I think I read it very later in life because if I had read it earlier, I would have opted for science as a career and not filmmaking. I was good in science and theoretical physics had always attracted me. However, this book is also the reason why I ranked less in my exams that year because this book started a chain of thoughts inside me which led me to buy more books and I ended up buying more books on the same subject, mostly by him and Roger Penrose, another author whom I love dearly. In the end, I would just like to say that this book is a must read and you should give it a go.\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nStephen William Hawking, one of the leading theoretical physicists on the planet and a very famous cosmologist, is the author of this book 'A Brief History of Time' and also many others. It explains relativity beautifully and tries to dig as deeply as possible into the wierd laws of physics and tries feverishly to explain the ultimate mystery: the theory of everything (or abbreviated to ToE).  The problem is the book was written BEFORE a certain period, and that was a very important period. Hawking lost a lot of... bets. For instance he said nobody would ever find the Higgs particle, a boson (force carrier) that is supposed to be the cosmic glue that gives all matter mass and,… practically makes everything behave the way it does. The Tevetron accelerator in Chicago, USA claims it has found the God particle. The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN in Europe has found its evidence THREE TIMES. The third time LHC found evidence of the Higgs Boson, it was certain that it exists. But nobody knows why Hawking claimed that the Higgs doesn't exist. It must have had something to do with his theory of inflation, in which he states that the universe was once nothing but an infinitely small, infinitely hot and infinitely dense singularity and then it popped (and inflated) out of no-where and no-when and then doubled in size 1,00,000 times in a trillionth of a second and it inflated and inflated for about 13.8 billion years until we get a universe like the one we see today. So, it's all baffled up. It's all a bizzare. Everyone has his or her throries. Now, according to me, we will have to count on experiments to take out the correct theory out of a zillion as we are on our quest to find out the beautiful truth, the true nature of reality, the... ToE.  Also, recently Stephen made a bet with South African theorist Neil Turok that gravitational waves are out there in the cosmos that would support his theory of inflation. Neil Turok was working with a theorist named Paul Steinhardt from across the Atlantic and their assistants Burt and Justin on a mind-bending theory called the m-theory (the sibling of the string theory). Neil states that the big bang was not a beginning but a collision. A collision between two extremely flexible surfaces called 'branes' (short for 'membrane'). This theory also says that for this reason, there can be no gravitational waves (and yeah, it also says that there are 11 dimensions, but leave that for a sec). So, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA) launched the Planck satellite to see if there are gravitational waves out there or not and which out of the two cosmological theories is true. Space organizations worldwide like ISRO and ENSARC awaited its answer until the results were out: it denied any evidence of gravitational waves, good for Turok. But a ground-based observatory states it has found evidence of gravitational waves. We are not sure what can we conclude, given that a space observatory is supposed to issue more promising and detailed results than a ground-based one. But most people believe Stephen lost this bet.  The biggest thing, that could perhaps prove the whole book wrong, is THE BLACK HOLE WAR. It was a war between Hawking and one of the most intelligent humans on Earth, one of the leading international theoretical physicists, Prof. Leonard Susskind. Hawking once claimed that one of the most sacred law of physics, the law of conservation of information, which states that you cannot destroy any information in the cosmos (for instance, even an atom bomb, or anything stronger you can imagine might vapourize everything in sight, but somewhere out there in the universe, that information is still there, no matter how scrambled), can be broken down inside black holes. He stated this fact after suspecting the evidence of the Hawking radiation when he saw that there are certain places in the universe where something called 'virtual particles' may become real: JUST near the event horizon of a black hole. Susskind completely disagrees at the fact that information can be lost inside black holes. He believed that this law cannot be broken anywhere, even inside these cosmic monsters. If information is lost, it means most of the modern physics had to be seriously flawed. This was way more than a bet. It was a war. After decades of researching, Susskind came up with a brilliant idea! He resolved a black hole paradox, usually called the dead-and-alive paradox, to win the black hole war. Imagine two astronauts, one named Ram and the other named Shyam, were going to explore a black hole in a space ship and see what happened to a human if he/she jumps into a black hole. When they got there, Shyam decided to jump out into the black hole. From Shyam's point of view, he smoothly drifted towards the black hole. When he reached the event horizon, he started feeling uncomfortable and was stretched somewhat like a Spaghetti, feeling more weight at the legs than the head. Then he started getting awfully fast and saw strange pictures. His brain collapsed and he was ripped apart when he approached the singularity. From his point of view, he died. And from Ram's point of view? He smoothly drifted towards the black hole but as soon as he reached the event horizon, Shyam froze in time. Now, what can we say about Shyam? In one scenario, he dies. In the other, he is frozen in time, but still alive. That is what we call the dead-and-alive paradox. Now Susskind resolved this paradox by substituting Ram's spaceship with a classic airplane with a propeller. Then he came up with a theory called the holographic principle. It says that all the 3-D universe is represented as a 2-D information in the very edges of our universe AND it also says that's why information CANNOT be lost inside black holes or anywhere in the cosmos. Soon, Hawking accepted defeat. And Leonard's theory became a fact. It forced everyone yo picture reality in a new way. Everything turned upside down. Leonard Susskind won the black hole war. Modern physics was now safe.  So, to conclude, I am not saying that Stephen Hawking is an unsuccessful physicist. No! He is one of the most successfull and greatest scientist since Einstein! Just wait if he publishes any other book. I am sure he would rewrite it completely in the correct way. Besides, you know what they say, that we all learn from our mistakes!  Boy, I can't believe I wrote this much! Besides, I'm not a fast typer. This took me one and a quarter hours to complete. Also, typing on a Kindle is a lot harder than on PCs. But still, to help.  Hope this helps.  Don't lose interest in physics. It's awfully interesting!\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nstephen william hawking one of the leading theoretical physicists on the planet and a very famous cosmologist is the author of this book a brief history of time and also many others it explains relativity beautifully and tries to dig as deeply as possible into the wierd laws of physics and tries feverishly to explain the ultimate mystery the theory of everything or abbreviated to toe  the problem is the book was written before a certain period and that was a very important period hawking lost a lot of bets for instance he said nobody would ever find the higgs particle a boson force carrier that is supposed to be the cosmic glue that gives all matter mass and practically makes everything behave the way it does the tevetron accelerator in chicago usa claims it has found the god particle the lhc large hadron collider at cern in europe has found its evidence three times the third time lhc found evidence of the higgs boson it was certain that it exists but nobody knows why hawking claimed that the higgs doesnt exist it must have had something to do with his theory of inflation in which he states that the universe was once nothing but an infinitely small infinitely hot and infinitely dense singularity and then it popped and inflated out of nowhere and nowhen and then doubled in size  times in a trillionth of a second and it inflated and inflated for about  billion years until we get a universe like the one we see today so its all baffled up its all a bizzare everyone has his or her throries now according to me we will have to count on experiments to take out the correct theory out of a zillion as we are on our quest to find out the beautiful truth the true nature of reality the toe  also recently stephen made a bet with south african theorist neil turok that gravitational waves are out there in the cosmos that would support his theory of inflation neil turok was working with a theorist named paul steinhardt from across the atlantic and their assistants burt and justin on a mindbending theory called the mtheory the sibling of the string theory neil states that the big bang was not a beginning but a collision a collision between two extremely flexible surfaces called branes short for membrane this theory also says that for this reason there can be no gravitational waves and yeah it also says that there are  dimensions but leave that for a sec so nasa national aeronautics and space administration usa launched the planck satellite to see if there are gravitational waves out there or not and which out of the two cosmological theories is true space organizations worldwide like isro and ensarc awaited its answer until the results were out it denied any evidence of gravitational waves good for turok but a groundbased observatory states it has found evidence of gravitational waves we are not sure what can we conclude given that a space observatory is supposed to issue more promising and detailed results than a groundbased one but most people believe stephen lost this bet  the biggest thing that could perhaps prove the whole book wrong is the black hole war it was a war between hawking and one of the most intelligent humans on earth one of the leading international theoretical physicists prof leonard susskind hawking once claimed that one of the most sacred law of physics the law of conservation of information which states that you cannot destroy any information in the cosmos for instance even an atom bomb or anything stronger you can imagine might vapourize everything in sight but somewhere out there in the universe that information is still there no matter how scrambled can be broken down inside black holes he stated this fact after suspecting the evidence of the hawking radiation when he saw that there are certain places in the universe where something called virtual particles may become real just near the event horizon of a black hole susskind completely disagrees at the fact that information can be lost inside black holes he believed that this law cannot be broken anywhere even inside these cosmic monsters if information is lost it means most of the modern physics had to be seriously flawed this was way more than a bet it was a war after decades of researching susskind came up with a brilliant idea he resolved a black hole paradox usually called the deadandalive paradox to win the black hole war imagine two astronauts one named ram and the other named shyam were going to explore a black hole in a space ship and see what happened to a human if heshe jumps into a black hole when they got there shyam decided to jump out into the black hole from shyams point of view he smoothly drifted towards the black hole when he reached the event horizon he started feeling uncomfortable and was stretched somewhat like a spaghetti feeling more weight at the legs than the head then he started getting awfully fast and saw strange pictures his brain collapsed and he was ripped apart when he approached the singularity from his point of view he died and from rams point of view he smoothly drifted towards the black hole but as soon as he reached the event horizon shyam froze in time now what can we say about shyam in one scenario he dies in the other he is frozen in time but still alive that is what we call the deadandalive paradox now susskind resolved this paradox by substituting rams spaceship with a classic airplane with a propeller then he came up with a theory called the holographic principle it says that all the d universe is represented as a d information in the very edges of our universe and it also says thats why information cannot be lost inside black holes or anywhere in the cosmos soon hawking accepted defeat and leonards theory became a fact it forced everyone yo picture reality in a new way everything turned upside down leonard susskind won the black hole war modern physics was now safe  so to conclude i am not saying that stephen hawking is an unsuccessful physicist no he is one of the most successfull and greatest scientist since einstein just wait if he publishes any other book i am sure he would rewrite it completely in the correct way besides you know what they say that we all learn from our mistakes  boy i cant believe i wrote this much besides im not a fast typer this took me one and a quarter hours to complete also typing on a kindle is a lot harder than on pcs but still to help  hope this helps  dont lose interest in physics its awfully interesting\\n',\n",
