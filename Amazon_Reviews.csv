""What did God do before he created the universe? Augustine didn’t reply: He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions. Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, and that time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.""Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey from the time when the world believed that Earth was the center of the universe and supported on the back of a giant tortoise to our age when we know better. Without the use of any mathematical equation, except the one famous mass energy equivalence relation by Einstein, he has explained the nature of our universe, from the smallest particles which cannot be seen to the biggest entities, the black holes in a simple language.The manner in which Hawking broke down complex concepts in theoretical physics, along with his adept use of humor, he clearly won over the readers who otherwise might have found themselves intimidated by physics and maths.I recommend it to all people who are interested in physics and cosmology but hate equations. 😄

A very good book.This book is like a tree.You can climb up that tree and when you reach the top you have a very clear view of everything . But climbing the tree up is somewhat difficult while you are still on the trunk.The first two chapters form this ""trunk"" and the rest are branches.If you suceed in climbing up the trunk then nobody can stop you from reaching the top.

There is no comparison of this book from the beaning of astronomy till the modern world and thoughts of future.The Grate Stephen Hawkings is the write which makes the book more legendary.Grate to read the language is not much difficult to understand .Nearly All my Dough of the space science has been cleared by this book.

A brief history of time... What a fascinating book! This is probably the first time I read through an entire book where I only understood a fraction of what was explained, due to my limited understanding on the topic. In other circumstances I would have left it incomplete. However with this gem, it made me wonder about various principles I had heard about in high school, and search for some cool videos online explaining them in an easy to understand language.If you have wondered about the big bang, black holes, elementary particles, general relativity, quantum mechanics, space and time, or the laws of the universe, this book is for you!This book reminds one of how beautiful, fascinating and intriguing our universe is! I don't think the author could have simplified things any further. I rate the book a 5-star for keeping me engaged, for making me explore concepts I wouldn't have otherwise, and for reminding me of the wonders of the universe.

This book is really a proof that why was Stephen Hawking One of the best Physicist after Albert Einstien ...I mean it explains the high level concepts in a way that anyone can easily understand ..You can easily understand the complexity of high level concepts in Easiest way..If you're a at least +1 student and a physics lover ...This one is for you..And it adds more interest If you are interested in astrophysics ...This book is a MUST...And the hardest thing about the book is that you can't put it down...once you start reading it...it makes you understand and inspires you to think,which I find very amazing

It is a great book for everyone. Writing the product review after few days of reading-Delivery- Well on time. Was informed over Email and SMS.Packaging- Well packed in the brown corrugated box with bubbles wrap inside.Book-  1. Lightweight material. Good to carry and in a small size.  2. Page quality and printing is average (expected at this price point) however not an issue with legibility.  3. Cover and back are thick paper with plastic coating.  4. The language is very simple and easy to understand. Any fifth standard and above child should be able to  read it. The understandabilty of contents is great due to easy language used.  5. The topics are covered in good detail with explanation. The interesting contents about space and time are  something that we should know and understand.I recommend this book for the people who has interest in Space, Time, Planets and Science. I great book for students.If you found the review helpful, please like it.

It’s a 200 pages of book which you might think is a one day read but actually it’s not. It’s complicated and hard to understand at times but what makes this book a masterpiece is the way Hawking explains all the scientific terms in a way that a normal brain can understand it. I loved the way he concluded the book by give briefings on Einstein, Galalio and Newton they were all two pages briefings but they changed my viewpoint on these scientists forever. Take your time and read this.

I haven't read the book yet so content wise I can't commend. But my problem is with it's quality. The paper quality is very poor and it looks like a second quality stuff. The original rate printed is 399 and I got it for 189 because of the amazon sale. Since I got it so cheap I don't have much to complain I guess, but those who want to buy a good hard copy of this book please look elsewhere. Will update about the actual book content when I finish reading it.

Book feels like a copied version. With unaligned texts on pages. Missing pages from 15-46 and ok print quality

The book is written by a Scientist who is not only authority on the subject but is also known for making science simple for a layman to understand.Right from the time of Aristotle ( 350 B C ), Scientists & Philosophers have been  trying to know more & more about our universe. This book tells us about the various models & theories made & modified from time to time to reach our present day knowledge of universe.At least high school knowledge and interest in  Physics is required to appreciate this book.

Wonderful Book, was made available by Amazon on the best price and in best quality. If you want to understand the nuances and intricacies of the universe and galaxies then this is the perfect book. Written in a language that even a layman can understand, makes this book simply one of the best books written so far. This is a must read for every science buff.
"
"
There is no point in reviewing the content of the book since it is one of the most popular science books written by one of the greatest scientists of modern era. But the book is not the original one. It is reprinted in India. Hence the poor quality of page and printing. This book is good for personal reading but not for presenting someone else.
"
"
This book is definitely capable of opening one's mind and can possibly answers deep old questions that one might have. This work of Dr Hawking is absolutely a delight to read as it will take you for a ride into the whimsical universe. The book will surely enlighten some questions that you'll be more glad to pursue throughout his writing. What not to say.. This is A Must read especially for the one who still carry in him a child like curiosity.
"
"
This book will change your view how to visualise the universe ... How theories came up ... Different views n experiments ... Simplified with perfect analogies ... What are the future prospect ... From relativity to quantum realm ... Though book needs certain basic acquaintance with physics n chemistry to comprehend thoroughly ...Genius was Stephen Hawking to see a virtual model of universe at its present state developing from past and time travel and many other interesting dimensions ...
"
"
This book is good for making a grand knowledge. Stephen Hawking takes us on a journey from the time when the world believed that Earth was the center of the universe and supported on the back of a giant tortoise to our age when we know better. He uses the Einstein's Energy-Mass relation, the Black Holes Ain't So Black. Hawking makes the Science clear & thrilling.Love this book. It's just a brief history of time from the Big Bang theory to the Black Holes.
"
"
Accompanying the insights provided by this book with spirited imaginations , you'll get a feel of how far the human intellectual threshold has been pushed from the beginning of scientific revolution and it's new dimensions that have made somewhat trivial the original framework of human reasoning about nature philosophy .
"
"
This book is a mind opener. Stephen Hawking explains how much we've understood about the universe we live in. The book is written in a simple manner so every one can understand the basic outlook of time, space and the universe using all the theories man has developed til date. Stephen Hawking is an excellent teacher who knows how to explain science in the simplest way possible- as said by many. This book indeed takes us back in time and explains the reality using science as the basic tool. I believe every human should read a book like this one and should be aware of the things that have surrounded him. Our quest for the real answer about the true nature of universe will go on till we understand what it is and why it is the way it is.

Legendary writing, everyone knows, am not reviewing that,. But the paper quality, printing quality is Terrible, just terrible. It is worse than the fake books u get at traffic lights.....
"
"
Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time has covered the distant shores of scientific history from Copernicus to Einstein and explains the developments and discoveries that have happened till date and how these theories have contributed in expanding our knowledge behind the origin of space, time and universe.Whether one is a physics student, a science enthusiast, or a layman.. this book is capable of sparking a further interest in the reader's mind to explore the vast area of scientific progress as well as problems that are inspiring human minds for years to uncover the mysteries behind the evolution of universe and that of our own existance.
"
"
BEST BOOK EVER AND AN INSPIRING BOOK WRITTEN IN NORMAL LANGUAGE ACCEPTABLE TO PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS....... WILL SURELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL........ CREATES A SPECIAL LOVE FOR SCIENCE

I considered buying this book long ago but could not manage somehow. This book is one of a kind and is definitely a prize possession written by the scientist of the millennium.

nicely written book by a master, makes it easy for a kid to understand the universe
"
"
The book is absolutely wonderful to read and is keeping me engrossed in it. But a major problem turned up- my book is missing pages from pg20-pg37. This wasn’t expected. I am missing out on a lot of information like this that the book has to offer. So i hope this doesn’t happen next time someone orders a book that the pages just aren’t there.
"
"
Very good book. Anyone can read it. Easy to understand, and the concept are explained in simple words. Many new and interesting concept are also discussed. Great book... And Amazon delivery service and packaging was great...Just loved it...
"
"
There are no words to explain the greatness and clarity of this book. The author takes the reader through a journey from Aristotle - proving the Earth was round - to Einstein and the author himself, providing the reader a basic idea of the evolution of our thoughts about the universe. Anyone with basic English can understand the book thorough, and as a plus point the ""only"" equation he has used in this book is Einstein's famous E=mc^2, making it easier for even an absolute beginner to grasp the concept of this book.
"
"
Content is Genius but paper quality is poor.@Publisher: plz don't forget you are publishing THE Stephen Hawking & his readers have Class. Kindly do not compromise on Quality rather charge accordingly.Thanks & Enjoy Reading 😊

"
This is first metaphysics book I read. There is no doubt, this legendary author had given beautiful insights about theories in this book.I would like to put a caution to future readers:This book require patience to digest some concepts. If you're sure you can get over it, then this is gem for science lovers.This book
"
"
I just loved the book. If you have even a small fraction of interest in Physics, you will love it. That's for sure.Page quality of this book is moderate, not great I would say.Though the packaging of the book while delivering was good enough, still I found some bad scratches on the front cover.As I brought the paperback version of the book, it's light weight and easily affordable.
"
"
steve makes abstract physics ideas accessible to the layman. i am particularly intrigued by the concept of singularity. excellent book. also what makes the book more palatable to the layman is that it is explained without complex mathematical equations.
"
"
This book is really not for someone with no science background. I was hoping to dive into the subject of science with a very naive knowledge I currently possess. However, I realize that, this is not for people like me. Maybe if you're studying science, you may find it interesting.
"
"
If you want to buy , Just Do it.I have suggested this book to all my fellows.And if you are here after watching the Movie [""The theory of Everything""] then i know you are motivated , Just Go it It !
"
"
I'm truly satisfied with it. It's awesome, and Original. Papers are best quality, Content is, we all know written by Legend Stephen Hawking and introduced by one of the greatest physicist of all time - Carl Sagan. Price is affordable and one must buy this as an introduction to ""Astrophysics for Beginners.""
"
"
Absolutely  amazing must read for all those into science or those who want to  pursue it .He in very simple terms tries to explain complex advances in science in very simple language . Although it was difficult to comprehend at some  sections but  it is definitely must read  book.
"
"
Then go for it... This is a good book and believe me you'll get the goosebumps all the way. Very well written by Sir Stephen Hawking considering that anyone can read and enjoy the book irrespective of their field of work.
"
"
Amazing book. Describing every aspect of Physics and Astronomy in such a lucid and easy language just as telling a story. Stephen Hawkings was a world class and higt talented scientist. His death is of immense loss for world of Physics and Astronomy. Hats off. RIP  Don't think twice before purchasing this book if you are interested in Physics and Astronomy.
"
"
If you're interested in atrophysics you must read this book since it was Stephen Hawking and he described all basic things in detail. If have read physics then it would be easy to understand

Right pricing and received in good condition. One of good options as gift for kids/students those who are interested  in science
"

This book is awesome it is based on Morden cosmology it has been the best seller in London for 4 years it is written in such a simple words that a average reader  can read it too .I highly recommend this book for the ones who are the fans of cosmology I appreciate this book and it's author MR.hawking
"
"
This book is so awesome I am easily able to understand  stuff in this book this is a marvelous. You should  buy this. I read some reviews  saying they don't  understand  this due to relativity, quantum mechanics, singularities, and more but I  am just 12 years and I understoodevery bit of it. Must buy
"
"
This book totally justifies the title it is given, it is basically a journey of the evolution of Physics our world has seen to date. Some parts can get really a bit difficult to understand for a non physicist.Going through this book will give you a good hands on knowledge of physics of the modern world.
"

Really mind opening. Although some parts were a little difficult to grasp,but mostly the book was written in a way to explain the content to readers of all levels.

Quality is very very bad. It couldn't get worse, chapter 1 is missing and the book starts from page 15.. truly terrible, never expected such pathetic service... I will never in future buy from Amazon, after paying the entire amount you are providing such terrible service. Disappointing 👎

Seems like a first copy. Paper quality is not as good as you would expect for an original book of this standard.
"
"
Difficult, but educating. Very difficult to complete in one set of readings.Require mental and imaginative involvement.
"
"
This type of books can only be written by people who had battled against all odds, and Stephen Hawkings is the best example for this. If you do not have the basic knowledge of our universe and you are curious to know, this is the book you want to read.
"
"
No point in rating the book because we all know its value. The other things, price, timely delivery, etc are excellent.
"
"
The book explains the toughest of concepts in the easiest way imaginable. A very intriguing and wonderful read, it keeps you hooked until the last page
"
"
One of the greatest physicists tried to explain a very difficult subject for non experts. Even a layman like me got to understand a small bit about the universe.
"
"
It is pure joy to travel with Hawking through the realm of theoretical and astro-physics ! This book is a reminder that science is an art where the scientist creates theories and later proves them.
"
"
Print media is of very poor quality.. Grey paper and small fonts.
"
"
A very good choice for those who are interested in space and time stuff. Hawking has described space and time in really great and easy way. It is a great book to read! Quality of the things mentioned in the headline are very good. Size of this book is small and handy.
"
"
A good read for anyone who wants to know how the universe evolved into the modern condition and how we came to be. It is enlightening and increases one's interest in science.
"
"
Book is so nice.sonetimes you may find it difficult to understand as theory is more and no mathematical equations are given
"
"
An hour spent in reading this splendid book is surely a journey around the cosmos.There is authentic style of shining intellect in every pages.A world famous book for general minds.
"
"
A very good book and timely delivery, but the book is not really for layman as proclaimed.some of the concepts and theories require a high level of science background to understand.
"
"
No doubt that the book must have inspired thousands of people to ask questions and persue the answers for.. How universe has been created? ... Where are we going?No more needs to be written in the review of this great book ..!!

It has great insights and can be astonishingly amusing. It explains the very basic of the universe with simplicity and just rips it apart in doing so. It is guide for understanding the universe better, if you the curiosity to know it.

It's a vetting document for ones sense of wonder. For me who has an above average probability of an apple hitting my head but who's job is to keep apples from falling from trees the book was fairly simple to read. One must read it , worst case scenario you will end up reading it more than once .

I suggest that everybody who has studied some physics ahould read this book. It is a great read and puts a lot into perspective. Written by one of the biggest scientists of our generation, this is a must read for a reader with some science background.
"
"
This books discuss about the history of time , that is assuming that the time as we know It started with the Big Bang which created the universe as we see it .I was originally interested in this book to get the glimpse of the time travel , and Stephen Hawking explains the complex scientific facts in simpler wayand has is expressing things then and there in humorous way , at times it was all like gibberish to me and trust me if you just continue to read without worrying about few things you could get a lot of information about the theories that astrophysicist has been worked and found the evidences proving them .I really had a good time reading it and would recommend this book . I would personally recommend to read the ""physics of the impossible "" by Michio Kaku which would help to get familiar with many concepts discussed here .
"
"
Dont listen to the reviews,  this is NOT for the layman. This book deals with theory of relativity, quantum mechanics,  singularities,  imaginary time and other complex topics. The concepts are so mind-boggling that even the simple language doesnt aid the understanding. Only for the VERY scientifically inclined.
"
"
Amazing book by one of the best scientist alived of 21st century. It was like, I went into the science and history, then into physics, slowly met many great ancient times inventor and philosopher as well as great scientists, learned about laws, systems, theories and much more about from big bang to one last unified theory of all. Oh.!!! My Ghosh.!!!! What a book. Must read for science lover.
"
"
A good printed copy. Reading the book is a good experience. It is a time travel with nobel laureate, the genius, Stephen hawking. It is explained in a lucid, teaching style. It is a time travel with the greatest astrophysicists in history explaining the evolution of science. It is good for students, science enthusiasts. It summarises all the important achievements in science in nutshell upto the time of writing of this book and caps it with the author's findings too.

What do we know about the universe? How do we know what we know? Where did the universe come from and where is it going? What is the nature of time? Did time have a beginning? Will it ever come to an end? If time had a beginning what was there ‘before’ it began? The Brief History of Time is Professor Hawking’s attempt to explain answers to these fundamental questions to the common people. Of course, we do not have the exact answers to all these questions but we have quite some understanding of the universe based on various scientific theories. Professor Hawking has tried to explain such concepts in a simple language without using any formula. Some theories and facts blew my mind. And some were too difficult for my understanding. But Professor Hawking surely tested my capacity to imagine and fascinated me by providing a glimpse of the vastness and mystery of our universe. If you have some interest in understanding the universe and various basic concepts of science (knowledge is not required; that will be provided by Professor Hawking) you will find the book fascinating.I have read reviews saying that this is a very simple and effortless read because of author's lucid writing style. That is not true. Although the book is written in a simple language, it is a book on science and some of the concepts are difficult to understand. So, do not expect this to be an easy and effortless read. If you are not inclined think or imagine on a little bit complex scientific topics, you may avoid reading it.
"
"
Stephen Hawking does full justice to the subject of the book...even having left learning of science a long time ago, one feels totally connected to the content right from beginning to the end...numerous concepts that will fascinate readers of all ages and from all backgrounds!!!

The quality of paper is very very very bad.It seems that this book was published in 1947.Very Poor paper quality...Diagrams and images are more poor.

I don't have words to describe this book.People having deep knowledge in Physics might find it less exciting though.But the way the information has been presented is way beyond awesome.
"
"
Progression of science is presented in this book,  particularly focused on basic questions humans ponder about. Hawking presents how it started out with philosophers to how the present situation is, in the field of cosmology. This book must be considered with philosophical viewpoint and not as a text book with equations in fact this book has only one equation in mathematical form and few others scattered in verbal form. Readers need not have to understand any equation or natural laws or theories defined in this book, hawking quickly digresses from these to connect with people without science background.Hawkings thoughts on God is clearly represented in this book. Through out this book Hawking shows how science advances gradually to understand the universe but man is thrown back, he ends up back in square one.  Readers can critisize this book or in fact science in philosophical terms, since even science has not given any answers yet. The byproduct of science, Engineering, has been phenomenal and hats off to them. Spoiler alert-- science hinges on few things today, they want answers from singularity(unified field) either from a black hole or unified field theory with good probability for the theory being true. And another parallel study is string theory. Hawking has proposed new theory in loop quantum gravity which is very far away from being true right now. All these three sectors and along with other researchers thinking out of the box seems to have hit dead end. The past few decades have been stagnant although they discovered gravitational waves and microwave background images, these would not even be good paintings to hang it in your home. Good luck linking gravity with quantum mechanics.Throughout the book you can observe how the author behaves like, he want to call himself smart person and brings about indirectly. Literally in the final page of the book hawking says Ludwig Wittgenstein is the most famous philosopher of 20th century, peraphs Stephen Hawking should go through Albert Camus whose philosophical ideas are logical. Wittgenstein was just an angry bloke.

As far as the delivery it was on time by Amazon, if you are a book lover Amazon is the best place for buying books than in any store in India; On for the books you want me tell. Stephen Hawking is genius he addressed every question I had from my childhood to till now, you don't need to be a science/physics student to read this book all the astronaut’s terms and things are elaborated to level that every human beings who reads this book is traveling with the Author in his journey through the universe.

A must read book if you are a fan of Mr.Stephen Hawking and love science. This book talks about the many hidden mysteries of our universe. It will surely broaden your aspect about the universe and how you see the concept of space-time. The best part is that, you don't need to be a science graduate or PhD in physics to understand this. Just some basic known and lots of curiosity about the universe is all you need and you will surely love it.

A perfect starting point for curious amateurs like me. Simple language, no complex equations (except the famous equation by Einstein), few helpful diagrams which together make it a very engrossing read.The product, however, was not brand new.

This is such an awesome read from one of the most pioneering scientist of modern times! You are glued to the book and don't want to get disturbed or do anything else. Though there are  not a lot of pictures or graphical figures, but the content is written in such a beautiful way that your mind automatically creates images of beautiful universe and leave you awestruck!!Step by step the mysteries of the universe are unraveled and you just  applaud .. Definitely a must buy!

"
The first few chapters are awesome and interesting, easy to understand. But the later chapters are pure science you need to have some basic knowledge about science terms and it's more technical. I felt like reading a science text book. But it's still great material , our mind gets an exposure to space in full.

The author has tried his best to explain the complicated concepts of physics so that a layman can understand. There are a few parts though that need multiple readings. Overall an informative read.
"
"
The universe and black holes explained beautifully by Mr.hawking. the book takes the reader into a world way beyond earth.it makes everyday things and thoughts feel tiny. Also generates tremendous respect towards the works of all scientists that have led to such deep understanding of the universe. Dr.hawking has explained all the concepts of physics required to understand the theories, in simple terms and sometimes in comic analogies. However I suggest ppl should get an idea of Einstein's general theory of relativity to get a better understanding of the book.

i'm really impressed about how easily Stephen Hawking explains cosmos in simple layman's terms, even though i've just read a few chapters, i have never been that into any book before. This book explains about space & time, origin of universe, black holes and many more interesting stuff about our universe. if you are a science lover then you are definitely gonna love this book. The downside is that the paper quality is poor and the book has a weird smell.
"

I once read somewhere that if there is a book that is sold more than bible than it was this book. Of course, I later found it to be an exaggeration by the writer of that fact but yes, it was sold heavily when it was released. First, the book is written by an enigmatic personality who despite having physical limitations has solely discovered many secrets of the universe. Stephen Hawking was already a hero before this book arrived and after this book, he became a sort of legend. This can be easily proven by the fact that he was the professor at the same university and was sitting in the same position where Newton used to sit 300 years back. Everyone bought this book but not many read as they found to be a little complex or rather assumed that since it involved physics so it was supposed to be a complex book. However, the entire book is just philosophy, some science and interesting trivia’s and facts about our world and beyond. There is only one equation used in the book and that too is the most familiar equation of all time. Even people who hate maths and physics know about the equation. The equation was E equals to M*C(square), the world-famous equation given by Einstein which changed the way scientists looked at the matter and helped them invent many things thereafter. The book is not autobiographical and the author never talks about himself in the book. He only talks about the universe and its law in the most basic fashion that there could be. I was in the final year of my school and I was preparing for my engineering exams when my cousin visited my home and during a casual conversation asked me whether I know that time is absolute. I was offended to know such a fact because it opposed everything I knew and was taught. I was like how can two different people have two different time zones. I totally negated him but then to prove himself right he asked me to read this book called “A brief history of time” which I had seen on books stands previously but never took the courage to buy it.Finally, I bought it and it opened my eyes to so many things about science which I didn’t know before. It opened an entirely new world for me like why we live in three dimensions and not more or less than that, and why time is relative and what is the exact meaning of the Einstein’s famous equation. I also got to know a lot about black holes which again I find it to be a very interesting topic and later I read an entire book on the same subject by the same author. There was a time when I thought that maybe Hawking’s was obsessed about Blackholes but after reading a lot about Black holes I came to know why. The theories about black holes solved myriads of mysteries of science. Black holes are also related to time travel, the most used and most favourite topic of writing for science fiction authors. This book is brilliant because even a man with no science background can read it and find it interesting. You don’t expect such kind of simple language from a scientist because normally such kind of topics are aimed at only a section of people who have a background on such topics. I think every kid should be made to read this book so that they can develop some interest in science. I think I read it very later in life because if I had read it earlier, I would have opted for science as a career and not filmmaking. I was good in science and theoretical physics had always attracted me. However, this book is also the reason why I ranked less in my exams that year because this book started a chain of thoughts inside me which led me to buy more books and I ended up buying more books on the same subject, mostly by him and Roger Penrose, another author whom I love dearly. In the end, I would just like to say that this book is a must read and you should give it a go.
"
"
U must know a bit physics to understand it...the topic that is difficult to understand is explained in a more understanding way
"
"
It's quite boring but one who loves universe should go for it. It is similar to the book ""the black hole and baby universes and other essays""
"
"
I bought this book from a local bookstore. I think this book is overrated. The book is nice but the way he tells the story is quite boring. No doubt this is one of the most unread book according to goodreads. This book is nice if you wanna show-off how intellectual you are to your friends but actually reading it a different thing. No doubt Stephen Hawking was a great scientist. What he did while being physically handicapped is astonishing and inspirational but I think he is not a great story teller/writer. You can find other pop. science books which are easier to read and enjoyable.
"
"
To start, I'm dumb. But even I was able to increase my quench for space knowledge by reading this masterpiece of a book.Before getting my hands on this brilliant piece of product, I used to watch a plethora of space related stuff on YouTube without being able to grasp the concept in the entirety. But reading this book alone has taught me rudimentary concepts in a clear and lucid way, Stephen Hawking was a scientist as we all know but I'd argue that he was an artist as well. Because teaching a subject as intricate as space using layman terms isn't exactly easy.I wish he was still present, nonetheless I'm grateful for his contribution.Anyway, as for the ratings, 10/10 would recommend.
"
"
It's a fake product, poor printing.plz don't buy
"
"
Simply unputdownable!!!! Can develop interest of astronomy,  particle physics to even an arts or commerce graduate also. The book is so well and lucidly written that you feel it is impossible to keep it down. The legendary Professor Hawking makes the most complicated of topics of physics very easy and interesting. You develop interest in the darkest secrets of Universe and that too by employing only ONE mathematical equation in the entire book....the very famouse = mc2....I wish he had also written some books about relativity also so as to understand the topics....hats off to the great man!!!!!
"
"
Amazing
"
"
This is one of the best book written by Stephen Hawking and I love this book soo much♥️.It is a very dense book tho. I've had to go back to re-read any paragraph or page to understand the concept behind it.Sometimes I also have to search for some words on google to understand the meanings. It has many theories explained by sir stephen Hawking which needs more than 1 read to make it clear.This book is definetly not for speed reading like any novel. Very hard to understand things but once you get it clear in your mind, you are gonna love this book, believe me!!!
"
"
A book by Stephen Hawking himself. Content and information provided by this book is not questionable. This book covers physics from Newton's to the ultimate explanation of universe, black hole and other topics. But I believe, to understand this book deeply people should first refer different books to understand some important laws such as relativity, Maxwell's equations, general relativity and other important topics. If people really know these topics then this book is very interesting.
"
"
It's a paperback book not hardcover. If you want hardcover of cost 1200 then get it, by the way if you use book in a good way, paper won't come out, I am using this book from 2015 still in good condition, so the review You See  about paper quality just ignore, it's you how you treat book

"
"
I'll start by stating that this is not a book for total beginners. If you know nothing about Astrophysics or Physics, in general then you're not going to understand this book. But if you are a little Scientifically inclined, this is one of the best non-technical books that you'll ever come across.

I was expecting the one with the cover from the photo given in description, but to my surprise I got the one with a different cover.It would be really sad for people who wants to make a collection of the original edition.

Stephen William Hawking, one of the leading theoretical physicists on the planet and a very famous cosmologist, is the author of this book 'A Brief History of Time' and also many others. It explains relativity beautifully and tries to dig as deeply as possible into the wierd laws of physics and tries feverishly to explain the ultimate mystery: the theory of everything (or abbreviated to ToE).  The problem is the book was written BEFORE a certain period, and that was a very important period. Hawking lost a lot of... bets. For instance he said nobody would ever find the Higgs particle, a boson (force carrier) that is supposed to be the cosmic glue that gives all matter mass and,… practically makes everything behave the way it does. The Tevetron accelerator in Chicago, USA claims it has found the God particle. The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN in Europe has found its evidence THREE TIMES. The third time LHC found evidence of the Higgs Boson, it was certain that it exists. But nobody knows why Hawking claimed that the Higgs doesn't exist. It must have had something to do with his theory of inflation, in which he states that the universe was once nothing but an infinitely small, infinitely hot and infinitely dense singularity and then it popped (and inflated) out of no-where and no-when and then doubled in size 1,00,000 times in a trillionth of a second and it inflated and inflated for about 13.8 billion years until we get a universe like the one we see today. So, it's all baffled up. It's all a bizzare. Everyone has his or her throries. Now, according to me, we will have to count on experiments to take out the correct theory out of a zillion as we are on our quest to find out the beautiful truth, the true nature of reality, the... ToE.  Also, recently Stephen made a bet with South African theorist Neil Turok that gravitational waves are out there in the cosmos that would support his theory of inflation. Neil Turok was working with a theorist named Paul Steinhardt from across the Atlantic and their assistants Burt and Justin on a mind-bending theory called the m-theory (the sibling of the string theory). Neil states that the big bang was not a beginning but a collision. A collision between two extremely flexible surfaces called 'branes' (short for 'membrane'). This theory also says that for this reason, there can be no gravitational waves (and yeah, it also says that there are 11 dimensions, but leave that for a sec). So, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA) launched the Planck satellite to see if there are gravitational waves out there or not and which out of the two cosmological theories is true. Space organizations worldwide like ISRO and ENSARC awaited its answer until the results were out: it denied any evidence of gravitational waves, good for Turok. But a ground-based observatory states it has found evidence of gravitational waves. We are not sure what can we conclude, given that a space observatory is supposed to issue more promising and detailed results than a ground-based one. But most people believe Stephen lost this bet.  The biggest thing, that could perhaps prove the whole book wrong, is THE BLACK HOLE WAR. It was a war between Hawking and one of the most intelligent humans on Earth, one of the leading international theoretical physicists, Prof. Leonard Susskind. Hawking once claimed that one of the most sacred law of physics, the law of conservation of information, which states that you cannot destroy any information in the cosmos (for instance, even an atom bomb, or anything stronger you can imagine might vapourize everything in sight, but somewhere out there in the universe, that information is still there, no matter how scrambled), can be broken down inside black holes. He stated this fact after suspecting the evidence of the Hawking radiation when he saw that there are certain places in the universe where something called 'virtual particles' may become real: JUST near the event horizon of a black hole. Susskind completely disagrees at the fact that information can be lost inside black holes. He believed that this law cannot be broken anywhere, even inside these cosmic monsters. If information is lost, it means most of the modern physics had to be seriously flawed. This was way more than a bet. It was a war. After decades of researching, Susskind came up with a brilliant idea! He resolved a black hole paradox, usually called the dead-and-alive paradox, to win the black hole war. Imagine two astronauts, one named Ram and the other named Shyam, were going to explore a black hole in a space ship and see what happened to a human if he/she jumps into a black hole. When they got there, Shyam decided to jump out into the black hole. From Shyam's point of view, he smoothly drifted towards the black hole. When he reached the event horizon, he started feeling uncomfortable and was stretched somewhat like a Spaghetti, feeling more weight at the legs than the head. Then he started getting awfully fast and saw strange pictures. His brain collapsed and he was ripped apart when he approached the singularity. From his point of view, he died. And from Ram's point of view? He smoothly drifted towards the black hole but as soon as he reached the event horizon, Shyam froze in time. Now, what can we say about Shyam? In one scenario, he dies. In the other, he is frozen in time, but still alive. That is what we call the dead-and-alive paradox. Now Susskind resolved this paradox by substituting Ram's spaceship with a classic airplane with a propeller. Then he came up with a theory called the holographic principle. It says that all the 3-D universe is represented as a 2-D information in the very edges of our universe AND it also says that's why information CANNOT be lost inside black holes or anywhere in the cosmos. Soon, Hawking accepted defeat. And Leonard's theory became a fact. It forced everyone yo picture reality in a new way. Everything turned upside down. Leonard Susskind won the black hole war. Modern physics was now safe.  So, to conclude, I am not saying that Stephen Hawking is an unsuccessful physicist. No! He is one of the most successfull and greatest scientist since Einstein! Just wait if he publishes any other book. I am sure he would rewrite it completely in the correct way. Besides, you know what they say, that we all learn from our mistakes!  Boy, I can't believe I wrote this much! Besides, I'm not a fast typer. This took me one and a quarter hours to complete. Also, typing on a Kindle is a lot harder than on PCs. But still, to help.  Hope this helps.  Don't lose interest in physics. It's awfully interesting!
